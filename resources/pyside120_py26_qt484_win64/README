This was downloaded from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyside,
installed on a windows machine and then simply moved into this location.

On Windows, Softimage uses python2.6 x64 by default so you need to use a 
binary distribution which is compatible with that.

If you choose to use an external version of Python then you should ensure
that a compatible version of PySide is also installed with it.
